# The problem solvers have found a new Island for coding and named it as Philaland. These smart people were given a task to make a purchase of items at the Island easier by distributing various coins with different values. Manish has come up with a solution that if we make coins category starting from $1 till the maximum price of the item present on Island, then we can purchase any item easily. He added the following example to prove his point.

# Lets suppose the maximum price of an item is 5$ then we can make coins of {$1, $2, $3, $4, $5}to purchase any item ranging from $1 till $5.

# Now Manisha, being a keen observer suggested that we could actually minimize the number of coins required and gave following distribution {$1, $2, $3}. According to him any item can be purchased one time ranging from $1 to $5. Everyone was impressed with both of them. Your task is to help Manisha come up with a minimum number of denominations for any arbitrary max price in Philaland.

# Input Format

# First line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.

# Next T lines contains an integer N denoting the maximum price of the item present on Philaland.

# Output Format

# For each test case print a single line denoting the minimum number of denominations of coins required.

# Constraints

# 1<=T<=100

# 1<=N<=5000

# Refer the sample output for formatting

# Sample Input:

# 2

# 10

# 5

# Sample Output:

# 4

# 3

# Explanation:

# For test case 1, N=10.

# According to Manish {$1, $2, $3,â€¦ $10} must be distributed.

# But as per Manisha only {$1, $2, $3, $4} coins are enough to purchase any item ranging from $1 to $10. Hence minimum is 4. Likewise denominations could also be {$1, $2, $3, $5}. Hence answer is still 4.

# For test case 2, N=5.

# According to Manish {$1, $2, $3, $4, $5} must be distributed.

# But as per Manisha only {$1, $2, $3} coins are enough to purchase any item ranging from $1 to $5. Hence minimum is 3. Likewise denominations could also be {$1, $2, $4}. Hence answer is still 3.
